[School of Computing](https://computing.unl.edu)  
[College of Engineering](https://engineering.unl.edu/)  
[University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://unl.edu)  

This lab continues with methods using enumerated types, class
instances as parameters, and formal unit testing using JUnit.

## Prior to Lab

* Read and familiarize yourself with this handout.
* Read the required chapters(s) of the textbook as
  outlined in the course schedule.

## Peer Programming Pair-Up

***For students in online section(s):*** you may complete
the lab on your own if you wish or you may team up with a partner
of your choosing, or, you may consult with a lab instructor to get
teamed up online (via Zoom).

***For students in the on campus section:*** your lab instructor
may team you up with a partner.  

To encourage collaboration and a team environment, labs are be
structured in a *peer programming* setup.  At the start of
each lab, you will be randomly paired up with another student
(conflicts such as absences will be dealt with by the lab instructor).
One of you will be designated the *driver* and the other
the *navigator*.  

The navigator will be responsible for reading the instructions and
telling the driver what to do next.  The driver will be in charge of the
keyboard and workstation.  Both driver and navigator are responsible
for suggesting fixes and solutions together.  Neither the navigator
nor the driver is "in charge."  Beyond your immediate pairing, you
are encouraged to help and interact and with other pairs in the lab.

Each week you should alternate: if you were a driver last week,
be a navigator next, etc.  Resolve any issues (you were both drivers
last week) within your pair.  Ask the lab instructor to resolve issues
only when you cannot come to a consensus.  

Because of the peer programming setup of labs, it is absolutely
essential that you complete any pre-lab activities and familiarize
yourself with the handouts prior to coming to lab.  Failure to do
so will negatively impact your ability to collaborate and work with
others which may mean that you will not be able to complete the
lab.  

# Lab Objectives & Topics

At the end of this lab you should be familiar with the following

-   Basics of enumerated types

-   How to use exceptions for error handling

-   Have exposure to a formal unit testing framework

# Background

## Enumerated Types

Enumerated types are data types that define a set of named values.  
The purpose of enumerated types is to organize certain types and
enforce specific values.  Without enumerated types, integer values
would be used, called "magic numbers."  This would require constantly
looking back to the documentation to find out which
numbers corresponded to which value.  Enumerated types provide
a human-readable "tag" associated with each value, relieving the
programmer of continually having to refer to the convention and avoiding
errors.

In Java, enumerated types are a special type of class in which you
define a list of values. An example:

```java
public enum DayOfWeek {
	SUNDAY,
	MONDAY,
	TUESDAY,
	WEDNESDAY,
	THURSDAY,
	FRIDAY,
	SATURDAY
}
```

Elsewhere in the code, you can use the enumerated type as follows.

```
//create a variable:
DayOfWeek today = DayOfWeek.MONDAY;

//make a comparison:
if(today == DayOfWeek.SATURDAY) {
  ...
}
```

## Exceptions & Error Handling

Errors in the execution of a program are unavoidable: users may enter
invalid input, or the expected resources (files or database connections)
may be unavailable, etc.  In Java, errors are communicated and handled through
the use of *exceptions*.  When an error condition occurs or is detected,
a program may `throw` an exception with a human-readable error message.  

Exceptions can give errors *semantic* meaning.  For example,
a `NullPointerException` and an `IllegalArgumentException` are two distinct
*types* of exceptions that can be distinguished (and thus *handled*
differently) by the language itself.  When the program executes a piece of code
that could potentially result in an exception, it can be handled by using
a `try-catch` block: we `try` to execute the snippet of code and, if an
`Exception` occurs (is thrown) then we can `catch` it and
handle it.  A block of code may potentially throw multiple different
types of exceptions.  You can write code to handle each exception in a
different manner or simply print a different message based on the error.  
A basic example:

```java
Integer a, b;
//read in a, b
try {
  if(b == 0) {
     throw new IllegalArgumentException("Division by " +
	"zero is not valid.\n");
  } else {
     c = a / b;
  }

  BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(
	new FileWriter("/etc/passwd"));
  out.write("result = "+c);

} catch(IllegalArgumentException e1) {
     System.err.println("Division by zero is undefined!");
     System.exit(1);
} catch(SecurityException e2) {
     System.err.println("You are not root, you " +
	"can't write to the password file! ");
     System.exit(1);
}
```

## (Re)designing Your Functions

In the previous lab you designed several functions to convert RGB values
to gray-scale (using one of three techniques) and to sepia. The details
of how to do this are available in the previous lab and are repeated for
your convenience below.

In this lab you will update these functions to make them a bit easier to
use and to utilize error handling. For the gray scale functions, there
was a function for each of the three techniques. We can simplify this
design and have only one function that takes another parameter: an
enumerated type that identifies which of the three techniques (average,
lightness or luminosity) are to be used. In addition, you will add error
handling to both functions.

We have already created and provided an enumerated type named
`GrayScaleMode` that specifies the three modes.  

1.  Implement the `toGrayScale()` method to convert the given
    `RGB` using the technique specified by the given `mode`

2.  Update both functions to check if the given `RGB`'s color
    values are all within the expected range of $[0, 255]$. If not,
    throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with an appropriate error
    message.

## Running Unit Tests

As with the previous lab, you can test your functions using the full
image driver program on the provided images or some of your own.
However, this is essentially an *ad-hoc test* which is not very rigorous
nor reliable and is a manual process.

In the last lab you wrote several *informal* unit tests. Writing unit
tests automates the testing process and is far more rigorous. However,
this involved writing a lot of boilerplate code to run the tests, print
out the results and keep track of the number passed/failed.

In practice, it is better to use a formal unit testing framework or
library. For Java, the standard unit testing tool is JUnit
(<https://junit.org/junit5/>). We have provided a JUnit testing suite
(see `ColorUtilsTests` that contains a number of unit tests for
your functions. A few observations about JUnit testing code:

-   There is no `main` method, but you can still run the file in
    Eclipse via the play button. It will launch JUnit and the framework
    will run all of the tests, producing a report on how many tests were
    run and how many passed/failed with some details on how they failed.

-   Methods are designated as "test" methods using *annotations*
    (`@Test` for example). This tells the JUnit framework that
    the method performs some unit test and makes an *assertion* about
    the result that can be used to determine if the test failed or
    passed. Annotations do not affect the code, but instead give it
    aspects or attributes that other code can recognize and thus affect.
    This is known as *Aspect Oriented Programming* (or *Attribute
    Oriented*).

-   A typical Eclipse project setup for JUnit involves separating the
    project code and testing code into different directories.  This
    project follows a standard convention of placing source code in
    a `src/main/java/` directory and testing code in the
    `src/test/java/` directory. Note that these are *not* packages.
    Generally, Testing code for a class is placed in the *same* package.

Run the test suite and verify that your code passes *all* the tests. Fix
any issues or bugs that become apparent as a result of this testing.
Passing 100% of the provided test cases will suffice to complete the
lab. However, we *highly encourage* you to read the JUnit test file to
understand how the tests are setup and performed and then to add a few
of your own tests.

# Color Formulas

To convert an RGB value to gray-scale you can use one of several
different techniques. Each technique "removes" the color value by
setting all three RGB values to the same value but each technique does
so in a slightly different way.

The first technique is to simply take the average of all three values:

$$\frac{r + g + b}{3}$$

The second technique, known as the "lightness" technique averages the
most prominent and least prominent colors:

$$\frac{\max \left\\{r, g, b\right\\} + \min\\{r, g, b\\}}{2}$$

The luminosity technique uses a weighted average to account for a human
perceptual preference toward green, setting all three values to:
$0.21 r + 0.72 g + 0.07 b$ In all three cases, the integer values
should be *rounded* rather than truncated.

A sepia filter sets different values to each of the three RGB components
using the following formulas. Given a current $(r,g,b)$ value, the sepia
tone RGB value, $(r',g',b')$ would be:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
  r' &= 0.393r + 0.769g + 0.189b \\
  g' &= 0.349r + 0.686g + 0.168b \\
  b' &= 0.272r + 0.534g + 0.131b
\end{array}$$

As with the gray-scale techniques, values should be
rounded. If any of the resulting RGB values exceeds 255, they should be
reset to the maximum, 255.

# Handin/Grader Instructions

Hand in your completed files:

-   `ColorUtils.java`

through the online handin system.  Be sure your program passes all tests to get credit.

# Advanced Activities (Optional)

## Custom Exceptions

In this lab you threw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the
`RGB` value was invalid. The exception was still generic/general.
You can make your own project-specific exception types by creating your
own class and *extending* a `RuntimeException`. Read the course
textbook for details and create your own `IllegalRgbException`
class. Modify your project to use it.

## Ant

Large projects require even more abstraction and tools to manage source
code and specify how it gets built. For Java, a popular build tool is
Apache Ant (<http://ant.apache.org/>). Ant is a build utility that
builds Java projects as specified in a special XML file
(`build.xml`). The build file specifies how pieces get built and
the inter-dependencies on components. Familiarize yourself with Ant by
reading the following tutorials.

-   <http://ant.apache.org/manual/tutorial-HelloWorldWithAnt.html>

-   <http://www.vogella.com/articles/ApacheAnt/article.html>

Provided in project is an example `build.xml` file. Modify it for
the code base you created in this lab and use it to compile and run the
code from the command line. In particular, from the command line:

1.  Place all source files into a folder named `src` in the same
    directory as the `build.xml` file (it should be like this
    already)

2.  Modify the `build.xml` file appropriately by specifying what
    your main executable class is. To do this, modify the
    `main.class` property's value to the fully qualified (full
    path name) class that you wish to run.

3.  Compile your project by executing the following command:
    `ant compile`

4.  Run your project by executing the following command:
    `ant run`
